	<Message id="ALPHA WORK1">Seu design foi promovido para a implementação.

A fase de implementação tem três etapas:

1. "Alpha", em que desenvolvedores e artistas criam o produto de acordo com as especificações e requisitos de projeto.

2. "Delay", Dependendo de quão competente os seus funcionários são, problemas inesperados podem surgir durante alfa, que precisam ser abordados antes de seguir em frente.

3. "Beta", em que os bugs são descobertos por seus programadores e, esperamos, corrigidos antes da versão final.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK2">Dependendo de se o seu software possui algum código ou arte, verá as unidades "código" e "arte" aumentarem. Estes tw informam mais ou menos quanto trabalho está sendo feito, quanto maior os números, quanto mais próximo o produto está a ser finalizado.
		
Esses números não contam nada sobre a qualidade real do código e da arte. Para ter uma idéia se o trabalho de seus funcionários é bom, você precisa fazer uma revisão por pares, comece pressionando o botão de revisão e selecione Equipe.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK3">Quando seu produto recebeu algumas avaliações, pressione o botão de fim para ver os resultados. Observe que a revisão é baseada em seu produto como era quando você iniciou a revisão, então qualquer trabalho feito depois não será contado.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK4">O resultado final será maior ou menor do que a qualidade real com base em quem o analisou. A equipe que desenvolveu o software provavelmente direi que é melhor do que realmente é.

Você pode analisasr a revisão para ver como os revisores obtiveram diferentes aspectos do seu software. A qualidade da arte e do código pode variar através do desenvolvimento com base na habilidade de seus funcionários e não depende da quantidade de trabalho realizado.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK5">Lembre-se de fazer um comunicado de imprensa durante o desenvolvimento também.

Durante o desenvolvimento, você também tem a opção de enviar uma versão de imprensa, para que a imprensa possa experimentar seu software. As versões de imprensa não requerem nenhum trabalho da sua parte, mas lembre-se de ter boas classificações em suas avaliações de pares e alguns seguidores antes de enviar uma.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK6">Pressione o botão Promover para avançar para a fase de deley quando você estiver pronto e o projeto passará para a fase beta automaticamente.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK7">A fase beta é teoricamente infinita, mas você terá que lançar seu projeto em algum momento, especialmente se você já anunciou uma data de lançamento.

É uma boa ideia consertar o máximo de bugs possível, pois os produtos bugados resutam em reembolsos, mas não queira corrigir todos os erros possíveis no seu produto. Quando o seu produto for lançado, você poderá consertar mais erros, à medida que seus clientes entrarem em contato com sua equipe de suporte.</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK8">Pressione o botão de lançamento quando estiver pronto.
		
Quando você liberar seu produto, você terá que comprar ou imprimir cópias físicas para vender. Mais tarde, a distribuição de software online se tornará mais popular, mas é muito importante ter cópias físicas do seu produto antes e durante a década de 90.
		
Você pode imprimir cópias físicas você mesmo ou mandar imprimir fora imediatamente por um preço mais alto. O jogo irá perguntar-lo sempre que você lançar um produto.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE1">Comece entrando no "modo de construção", clicando no botão construir.</Message>

	<Message id="BUILD MODE10">Agora, adicione uma cadeira. As cadeiras só podem ser adicionadas às mesas.

Observe que alguns móveis, como cadeiras e mesas, podem ser substituídos por versões alternativas depois de terem sido colocadas. Você pode usar o menu de contexto do botão direito para substituir facilmente muitos móveis ao mesmo tempo, selecionando todos os móveis do mesmo tipo nas salas selecionadas, por exemplo.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE11">Finalmente, adicione um computador. Quando você adiciona um computador, mantenha pressionado o lugar onde deseja adicioná-lo e arraste o mouse na direção que desejar, solte o botão do mouse para colocá-lo.

Os computadores devem sentar-se em cima de uma mesa e enfrentar uma cadeira.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE12">Quando você coloca as mesas ao lado, elas serão agrupadas se não tiverem nada em cima delas. As mesas agrupadas podem ser usadas para reuniões. Para ver quais mesas são agrupadas, basta destacar uma tabela e seu grupo será destacado em azul.

É importante que você controle os níveis de ruído em seu ambiente de trabalho, tente habilitar a sobreposição de áudio para ver o que o mobiliário está fazendo barulho.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE13">Seu fundador não está cansado, com fome, frio, solitário, estressado, precisa de quebra de casa de banho ou fica irritado em geral, mas quando contrata novos funcionários, eles irão.

Now, let's exit Build mode.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE17">When you are ready, open the employees window to start managing your employees.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS1">Start by opening the contract window.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS2">This is a list of available contracts. New contracts will be added as older ones are completed.

Contracts have an upfront payment you will receive for accepting the work, and a bigger payment for completing it. You complete a contract by delivering the code and art units requested.

Try selecting a contract in the list now.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS3">The final payout will be subtracted from, for not completing the contract and on time, and for any unfixed bugs.

Not living up to the clients quality expectations will impact your business reputation, but not your payout.

Browse the contracts now and accept one that requires some code units.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS4">Until an employee actually starts working on the contract, the deadline will not count down.

During the design phase, your employees will reduce bugs in the final delivery and increase quality. Make sure you Promote your design as soon as the progress bar reaches the end, to avoid over engineering.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS5">When code and art units (if any) reaches the client's target value, you have completed the contract, you can continue working on it if you want to deliver a better product.

Make sure you do a client review before you move on to the bug fixing stage, to make sure it lives up to their quality expectations.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS6">When you are ready, move on to the bug fixing stage.

It's impossible to know exactly how many bugs a piece of software has, so just try to fix as many as you can before time runs out.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION1">Welcome to the customization screen. Press "Continue" to advance the tutorial or "Cancel" to exit.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION2">Begin by picking a name for your company.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION3">Then pick a name for your founder in the game.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION4">And a gender.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION5">You can use these buttons to choose an aspect of your founder's appearance that you want to change.
	
You can change the shape of the face and eyebrows by clicking the first button, and the last button allows you to pick the colors of the skin, hair, accessories and clothes of your founder.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION7">Here you can pick you founder's personality traits.

You can choose two traits, which will affect your founder's behavior, listed below, and inter-office relationships.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION8">Here you can pick you founder's skill points and specializations, which will affect the performance of your founder.

Specializations are limited by skill, so if your founder has low design skill, he/she will also be low skilled in the design specialization you pick.

You can further educate and train your founder to gain skill and specializations in the game.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION9">You are now done customizing your founder. Let's begin choosing the rules of the game!</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION10">You can enable any mods here, which will be bound to the game forever.

You can share your game with others, without them having to install the mods.

Some mods add scenarios, so you should enable the ones you want before picking a scenario.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION11">Now pick a scenario. The scenario will control the starting money and starting date you can choose between, and goals and whether to simulate the competition, use a scripted competition or both.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION12">You can change the environment here.

The forest is the default environment, the tundra is cold all year, the desert is hot all year and the city has skyscrapers and a pre-built road network with parking lots.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION13">Difficulty can be changed at any point in the game by going to the options menu. Difficutly controls how easy it is to break into the market.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION14">Normally 1 day is equal to 1 month in Software Inc. This keeps the game at a steady pace so it doesn't get boring.

If you feel the game is going too fast or you want a couple of buffer days to earn money between having to pay salaries and bills, you can increase the amount of days there is in a month.

Note that everything in the game will move relatively slower to match the setting you pick and you can't change it later on.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION15">Click the Start game button to begin playing</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT1">Start the tutorial by pressing the "Develop software" button to bring up the design document.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT2">Welcome to the design document, the heart of Software Inc.

Start by picking a software type.

Click continue to to advance the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT3">If applicable, you can pick a software category. Each category for a software type has different development times, popularity, audience retention, features and its own target audience.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT4">Then pick a name. You can either write one yourself or press the "Name:" button to have it generated.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT5">You can also pick a price. If you leave the price field alone, the best price will be picked based on the software and features you've chosen. You can click the Price button to reset the price.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT6">Now you must pick features for your product. Each feature takes time to develop and balances innovation, stability and usability, so pick carefully.

The features you can pick depend on which software dependencies and operating systems you chose, and vice versa, when you select a feature, all dependencies and operating systems you can pick will be filtered accordingly.

Some features are artistic in nature and you will need artists on the team to get the best result.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT7">You can use these buttons to quickly select features. Note that it might not always be best to just select all features.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT8">Your product can depend on other software types. As an example, you will need a visual tool, like an image editor, to make a game with 2D graphics or you won't be able to make the graphics for it.

The features you pick will determine what type of software you need to develop your product and the quality of the dependencies will affect the quality of your product.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT9">Pick a software you want to use from the list by selecting it and pressing "OK".

You can filter software by features, the features you can pick for your software will sometimes depend on the features of the software you pick here.

Take special note of quality and license costs. Your software's quality will depend on the quality of the software you pick and you will have to pay the license fees.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT10">Some software runs on an operating system and some software can only run on operating systems that the software it is built on can run on, e.g. Games can only run on the operating systems that its Game Engine can run on. And as before, your features might also depend on which operating systems you choose to support.

You can pick your operating systems here. If nothing is shown, the software type you picked is not operating system dependent.

Press "Continue" to carry on.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT11">You can make your software a sequel to a product you made previously or which you have bought from another company. You do this by clicking this button and selecting a product as you did with operating systems and software needs.

Making a sequel will give a marketing boost and change your fans' expectations depending on the success of its predecessors.

Features that were implemented for the predecessor will be highlighted in orange in the feature panel, these features will be developed faster when you develop your product.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT12">You can also make your software in-house, which means you won't sell it to other companies.

You can use this to develop top quality game engines and only use them for your own games, to gain an advantage over other companies.

If this is not visible, it means the software you picked is meant for an audience and it wouldn't make sense to keep it in-house.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT13">If your software depends on server functionality, like an MMO, you will need to pick a server from this list.

If your servers cannot handle the load this software will generate, they will quickly burn out and you will lose your reputation.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT14">Finally, you can pick a source control server from this list to support the development.

Using source control will decrease bugs and speed up development, if your server can handle the load.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT15">After you've went through the phases of development and you're ready to release your product, remember to see if any popular products have just been released in the same software category as yours.

You can also check out upcoming releases from your competitors to make sure a large company won't outshine your product.

Timing is everything when you're just starting out!</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT16">Before you finish, make sure you inspect the information in this box. This outlines everything you need to develop this product.

Take special note of consumer reach. Consumer reach is how many people can potentially purchase the product as of right now, this number might decrease or increase as you develop the product. For software that depend on operating systems, it will be limited by how many people are currently using the operating system and it's successors.

Having more than the suggested amount of employees on the development teams will not increase development speed, but might actually reduce it instead.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT17">Click the develop button when you're ready to begin development.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK1">To start developing your software, designers need to piece together a document, which describes how the software should be developed and structured, to make sure everyone is on the same page.
	
Design work items are worked on by designers or employees in "Any role" until you promote the work item to alpha. Good design documents will make it easier for programmers to write good quality code and reduce the amount of bugs in the final product.

Press "continue" to advance the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK3">The work item will slowly fill up as it progresses. For design documents it is important to stop when the task is completely green, so you don't lose quality. If you wait too long, inexperienced designers will begin over-engineering.
		
While you wait, you should start telling the world about your new software. Start by announcing a release date by pressing the Market button.

You'll have to do some guess work when picking a release date, but it will increase the effectiveness of all your future marketing efforts with your product. Just make sure you release it on time!</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK4">Before you move on to development you should make a press release to tell the world about your product.
		
When you market your product before it's released you build a following, who will buy your product when it releases. Your followers might not all buy it straight away or might refund it, so they are not guaranteed sales.

Your employees will have to work on making the press release, so if you think it'll take a while, you can pause your design work by pressing the play button, to avoid over-engineering.

Start by bringing up the marketing window again.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK5">Make sure you read the text in the marketing window, as it tells you how to handle the different marketing actions available to you.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK6">Click the Develop button to begin development when you are ready.

Right click the title bar of the work item to toggle between normal and collapsed view.

When you are ready, open the distribution window.</Message>
	<Message id="DISTRIBUTION6">To start selling products through your own digital online store, you can click this button and pick a server to run the store on. Note that running your own store requires a lot of bandwidth if a product is selling well.

You need to set up deals with other companies individually, if you want them to sell their products through your store.

Open up the companies window now, to start making distribution deals.</Message>
	<Message id="DISTRIBUTION7">Click on the details button on a company you want to make a deal with, the window will have a button to suggest a distribution deal, if applicable.

You can choose to either educate your employee in a skill, specialization or you can enable HR by checking one of the options in the bottom of the education window.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION3">Start by choosing the amount of months to educate your employees. Note that educational courses are considered paid leave, so you will also be paying salaries on top of course expenses.

There is a limit to the skills and specializations of your employees, so if you pick 3 months of courses for an employee with a high skilll level, you'll be throwing money out the window.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION4">Then pick what role you want to educate your employees in.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION5">If you picked Designer, Programmer or Artist, you should pick what specialization you want them to improve in. Click "Start education" when you are ready to send your employee off.</Message>

	<Message id="STOCKS1">In the upper right corner of the company window, you will see a list of stocks.

The first stock in the list is the company's own share, which you can buy if you have bought all other stocks in the list.

You have two options when you buy a company's main share, you can buy them out or make a subsidiary of your own company.

Buying out a company will give you their IP and their patents. Making them a subsidiary will allow them to continue and share patents, distribution platforms and IP with you, but you can deposit and withdraw money from them, and close them at any time.

When a company goes bankrupt, all its assets will go to the majority shareholder.</Message>
	<Message id="STOCKS2">When you own stock in another company, that company will pay dividends to you each month, which is the percentage you own in the company of their surplus for that month, divided by 24. You will also have to pay dividends to companies that own stock in your company, but it is an easy way to loan money.
		
Alternatively, you can buy the stock when it is cheap and sell it high, by trying to predict how the company will do, based on its history.

You can see which stocks a company owns in the bottom left panel.</Message>
	<Message id="STOCKS3">In the bottom middle of the window you can see the company's patents. If you develop products with any of the features listed, you will have to pay royalties to this company out of its profit. If you own stocks in the company or the company is a subsidiary, royalites do not apply.</Message>
	<Message id="SUPPORT WORK1">When you release a new piece of software it will spawn a support work item. Through this work item you will receive support tickets from your customers, assuming you have any.
		
Support tickets should be answered as quickly as possible. Employees with good programming skills will be able to verify specific bugs quickly as tickets are answered, which your employees will then proceed to fix.

Support for a product never ends by itself, so you'll have to end it when you don't think support is necessary anymore. Keep an eye on the active user count to help guide you.</Message>
